									<p>Sanitary fittings are an important part of the brewing process. They are easy to clean,
									inspect, and sanitize. This is especially important after the boil when a sanitary environment
									is absolutely necessary. Most breweries uses "tri-clamp" style fittings that consist
									of two flat fittings that are clamped together with a gasket between so that they can be fully 
									disassembled for cleaning.</p>

									<p>Each recipe starts as a blend of malts and potentially adjuncts that 
									combine to create the malt flavors we all love. The grain portion of the 
									recipe or the "grain bill" dictates malt flavor, alcohol content,
									color, clarity, and provides essential nutrients that yeast need during 
									fermentation.</p>

									<p>The Mash tun is a special kettle where the milled grain is mixed with
									hot water and then rests while enzymes convert the starch to sugars. 
									The mash tun is constructed with a special "false bottom" which is a series 
									of grates that allow the sugar water or "wort" to flow out of the 
									mash tun and on to the boil kettle, while keeping the "spent grain" 
									in the mash tun for removal later. Spent grain consists of the husk material
									and other parts of the grain that aren't converted to sugar.</p>

									<p>"Mashing In" is the process of mixing the grain with hot water. 
									It is important to mix the grain and water well to avoid "dough balls" 
									or lumps of grain that stay dry. Dough balls will cause a lowered mash efficiency 
									which can affect flavor and alcohol content. They can also cause issues with flow 
									when the wort is separated from the grain during the "lauter"</p>

									<p>The lauter is a process where the clear sugar water (wort) created during the mash 
									is separated from the residual "spent grain". The process starts by recirculating 
									the wort from under the false bottom in the mash tun, back to the top of the grain bed.
									This process, called the "vorlauf", helps filter the wort through the 
									grain husks and false bottom grates. After the vorlauf is complete the clear wort is transferred 
									from the mash tun to the boil kettle which completes the lauter.</p>

									<p>The boil kettle is fired up part way through the lauter and is nearly at boil 
									temperature when the transfer is complete. we boil wort for three main reasons; 
									first the boil sterilizes the wort, second the boil drives off compounds that can 
									contribute off flavors like DMS (cooked corn flavor), and lastly we add hops to the 
									boil for flavor and shelf stability. The length of time
									hops spend in boil determines how much bitterness is extracted (the longer the boil 
									the more bitterness up to a certain point) and the amount of flavor and aroma compounds 
									that are left in the wort (boiling can drive off oils and aerosols in a relatively short time).</p>

									<p>After the lauter is over, and all of the wort has been transferred into the boil kettle, 
									the heavy lifting can begin. The spent grain needs to be removed from the mash tun so that 
									the next mash can begin. We send our spent grain to a local farm where it is mixed with livestock
									feed which makes for happy cows! Our mash tun has rotating plows that help remove the grain but 
									there is no replacement for good old fashion elbow grease to clear out all of the grain.</p>

									<p>After the boil is complete we need to cool the wort to a temperature that our yeast will thrive in.
									It is also important to keep everything the wort comes in contact with as close to sterile as possible. 
									We chill our wort using a plate heat exchanger which is a closed system that has many stainless steel plates
									that alternate between the hot wort and cold water. After the wort is cool, we add oxygen which helps the 
									yeast multiply, and pump it into a fermenter.</p>

									<p>Once the wort has been transferred into a fermenter we need to add the yeast. There is an old adage 
									that "brewers make wort, but yeast makes beer" and that is mostly true. Yeast eat the sugar 
									from the wort and turn it into alcohol, co2, and other flavor components. Brewers do however need to 
									pitch the correct amount of healthy yeast, and control the fermentation temperature among other things.</p>
