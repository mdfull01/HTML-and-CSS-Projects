				<p>How can you tell when a beer style has run its course? Are their attributes 
				to that style that can be manipulated or accentuated with the addition of adjuncts
				or finishing processes? Let's break down the unique style characteristics that a red
				IPA should possess</p>

					 Like most IPAs, it’s characterized by a relatively high BU:GU ratio (especially this recipe!),
					 more malt character than a traditional American IPA (though less than a Barleywine or American 
					 Strong Ale), and high levels of hops aroma and flavor. Many classic examples are also high in 
					 alcohol, but the style doesn’t require it...
